# how to balance actions and items


things which need balancing:
- how powerful actions are vs their "cost" (money/constraints)
- how strong enemies are, how to build them, how many to encounter

robots of "equal strength" should win each other 50/50 if they use the same strategy.

- if got an electric weapon, need at least 1 charge storage & 1 charge generation
- if got a pressure weapon, need at least 1 pressure generation, 1 water storage
